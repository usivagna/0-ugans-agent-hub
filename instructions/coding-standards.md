## Instructions

- Follow the project's existing code style and conventions
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Keep functions under 30 lines where possible
- Handle errors explicitly — don't silently swallow exceptions
- Write pure functions when possible; minimize side effects
- Use typed parameters and return types in languages that support them
